FIXES
	- Store the armed/IFF state in the craft files instead of just the GUI strings.

v1.4.5.0
FIXES
	- Fix the floating origin corrections to the vessel traces and apply the corrective rotations to the coordinates such that the local coordinates are (east, up, north) and the identity rotation is a craft pointing nose up with the underside pointing north. Include a simple python script to plot the traces.
	- Re-enable the extending debugging (when debug labels are on).
	- Fix the smoothing of the target acceleration and velocity for long-range targets to be applied dynamically so as to not affect short range targets and to reset when switching targets.
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Update the in-flight Guard Menu to match the settings in the weapon manager in the SPH.
	- Dynamically adjust (max) gun range based on the guns that are actually on a vessel.
	- Add log and competition status messages about disabling a vessel due to EMP damage.
	- Upgrade the numerical integrator for bullets and ballistic trajectory simulations to use the 2nd order symplectic leapfrog method (this vastly improves the accuracy and speed of the trajectory simulations). Allows for ballistic aiming out to at least 50km.
	- Include dead teams information in the results.
	- Re-worked steer limiter. Steer limits are now based on two control points, defined by four variables
		- Low Speed Control Point: Steer limit and Speed
		- High Speed Control Point: Steer limit and Speed
		- Below the low speed control point speed, the limit will be equal to the low speed steer limit.
		- Above the high speed control point speed, the speed will be equal to the high speed control point limit.
		- Between the two control points, the steer limit will vary linearly based on the craft's current speed.
	- Add toggle for whether competition status messages are displayed.
	- Change clearance check minimum drop time to greater than or equal to 0.1s instead of greater than 0.3s
	- Add 1.5 safety factor to blast radius determination for missile evasion
	- Clamp the minimum radar missile FOV used for missile evasion to 40 degrees, results in fewer instances of craft turning back towards a missile at inopportune times.

v1.4.4.4
FIXES
	- Fix missiles firing without exhaust and heat-seeking missiles firing without a target.
		- Regenerate exhaust prefab object pools when they're detected to contain nulls due to scene changes or reloads.
		- Trigger missile exhaust prefab detachment on part.OnJustAboutToDie and OnDestroy as well.
	- Add KeyNotFound and NRE checks in CheckForMissingParts.
	- Add in SetupAudio fix in some other places for audioSource. Add check for broken animations and give error instead of exception.
	- Remove ramming debugging toggle and just use the regular debug labels toggle instead. Adjust the debug statements in DebrisDelayedCleanUp.
	- Don't update RCS if we've just fired a missile or are trying to fire a missile.
	- Correctly calculate turret gimbal limits check, taking into account bullet drop.
	- Add generic rocket resource for rocket ammo boxes (fixes rocket launchers not being able to use rocket ammo boxes)

v1.4.4.3
FIXES
	- The improved aiming code is now fixed (properly accounts for movement of the aiming vessel). Planet curvature is not yet taken into account.

v1.4.4.2
FIXES
	- Revert the improved gun aiming code as it's not working properly for non-stationary targets.
	- Fix potential NRE in DetachExhaustPrefab.

v1.4.4.1
FIXES

	- Re-add laser min range check.
	- Multitargeting:
		- Multitarget now multitargets missiles.
		- Fix part targeting not resetting properly.
		- Update the target parts lists correctly. Only triger target part list updates when toggling options instead of every frame when the settings are open.
		- Add check for the list of targetable parts being empty.
	- Remove arc length term from DLZ calculation for ground launched missiles (this was breaking VLS parts).

IMPROVEMENTS
	- Missile evasion:
		- Behavior changes to notch and dive against missiles, pull away before impact for heat seekers only (continuing to notch is more effective against radar missiles). Fix spinning in place behavior that had occurred occasionally.
		- Simplify entry conditions for missile evasion behavior (only occurs within threshold of when your craft is set to dispense chaff/flares regardless of whether it has chaff or flares onboard).
		- Proper throttle settings for chaffing vs flaring.
		- Add check if radar missiles are still boresighted towards craft as a condition to treat missiles as a threat.
	- Shift 'AimAndFireAtEndOfFrame' to occur during the FashionablyLate timing phase of FixedUpdate and rename it 'AimAndFire'. This synchronises firing with the physics instead of waiting until the scene is rendered. It also occurs before Krakensbane adjustments have been made.
	- Simplify target threat to either be 0 (not under attack) or 1 (under attack).
	- Make Kerbal Safety a slider instead of a toggle to allow disabling ejection from cockpits, but still have existing kerbalEVAs deploy parachutes.
	- Add 'Start Comp. NOW Delay' slider for automatically triggering 'Start Competition NOW' after a given delay.
	- Tournament results parser:
		- Add missile hits taken to the parser ('HitByMis' in console output, 'missileHitsTaken' in CSV file).
		- Hide empty columns in the parser console output.

	- Limit 'firing at me' detection (from guns) to the range of the weapon being fired.

IMPROVEMENTS
	- Make altitude limits independent of RWP and change localisation.
	- Make missile targeting check depend on blast radius of incoming missile instead of fixed at 60m and include check for passing in close proximity.
	- Return a full list of incoming missiles sorted by distance in UpdateGuardViewScan instead of just the first found.
	- Convert 'under attack' and 'under fire' routines to maintain their state until 1s after last notification instead of simply resetting after a fixed period.
	- Adds Impulse/Gravitc functionality for ballistics/rockets/lasers
		- Adds some new configuration fields
			- impulseWeapon = foo //gun/laser will deal impulse instead of damage
			- Impulse = n //magnitude of impulse delivered per bullet/rocket/pulse laser shot, and impulse/sec delivered by beam lasers. setting this negative will make attractor lasers instead of repulsor lasers
			- graviticWeapon = foo //gun/laser will temporarily modify mass of hit part
			- massAdjustment = n //mass, in tons, added per sec by beams or per hit by bullets/rockets/pulselasers
		- Adds some new rocketdef config options
			- gravitic = foo //rocket will temporarily modify weight of parts hit by rocket and its explosion
			- impulse = foo //rocket applies non-damaging impulse to parts hit by rocket/explosion
			- choker = foo //rocket will temporarily disable air intakes caught in its blast radius

	- Reloading/MultiTarget fix/weaponPriority
	- Multitarget fix
	- Chernobyl bugfixes
	- Various NRE fixes

IMPROVEMENTS
	- Separate bullet movement and collision detection into separate functions. Detect collisions in the initial frame of a bullet so point blank shots work.
	- Detect exit collision with objects when the barrel of the gun is within the object's collider, i.e., sub-point-blank shots.
	- Added a slider for configuration of specific RWP rounds.

	- Remove null-coalescing operators from Monobehaviours as they don't work in Unity.
	- Multi-Target barrage fix: weapons targeting a target outside their fire arc will now be skipped instead of bringing the barrage to a halt until the offending weapon can be brought to bear.

IMPROVEMENTS
	- Added a few more interesting spawning points (currently requires removing the old spawn_locations.cfg file in order to update, this will be changed soon).
	- Re-work rocket damage to do kinetic damage and penetrate armour and correctly report scoring info.
	- Shared bullet/rocket code moved to Misc.ProjectileUtils.cs.
	- Weapon priority adjustments:

	- Disable (missing) legacy code analysis tools in .csproj.
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Explosive damage penetration:
		- Basic explosive damage penetration handling. Parts closer to the explosion are ablated first with a small amount of bleed through for relatively weak parts.
		- Add comment on original BDA methodology source. Calculate positive phase time based on source method equations. Correct CalculateIncidentImpulse not bounding scaledDistance

		- Rename Target Acceleration to Target TWR since that's what it is
		- Change firing angle to scale with distance and size of target.
			- Include maxDeviation/2 from the weapon in the firing angle calculation to allow more firing at longer range for spray-and-pray guns. Increase max firing angle to 3.
			- Prioritize weapons that are within their firing angle.
			- Adjust weapon prioritisation of being within firing angle for firing angle scaling with target size and distance.
		- Added VIPs, which allow you to set up behavior such as guarding your VIP, or attacking enemy VIPs and ignoring craft defending them.
			- Add new "Is VIP" toggle to the weapons manager. Allows you to set a craft as a "VIP" which opens up new target priority options.
			- Added new target priority options "Protect My VIPs" and "Attack Enemy VIPs". Setting positive values on these sliders will result in the craft targeting enemies that are targeting VIPs on its own team, or attacking enemy VIPs, respectively.
		- Don't try to engage torpedoes with guns/missiles/lasers.
		- Use other weapons for ground targets if missiles fired is greater than or equal to max missiles on target setting.

	- Fix BDRotaryRail stack overflow and give warning if the conditions that gave rise to it occur again.
	- Put chute into right state before deploying it with WM AG.
	- Don't assign gender to spawned kerbals, let KSP do it.
	- Fix CheckSafeToFireGuns for debris preventing firing due to being too close to the target.
	- Reduced (but not eliminated) exceptions due to comet vessels.
	- Change the minimum damage amount of 0.01 to 0 as this was the cause of the fire damage over time applying despite the game being paused or slowed with time control.
	- Fix NREs in explosions from ClusterBomb.cs
	- Add KSP version dependent checks for part.IsKerbalEVA and crew.ResetInventory.
	- Updates Rocket targeting, fixes aimer alignment
	- Updates laser Infos with proper resource usage
IMPROVEMENTS
	UI and quality-of-life tweaks:
	- Add fault tolerance for missing bullet defs in GetInfo.
	- Add similar handing of missing or broken rocket info as for bullet info.
	- Move ConfigNode functions to their own translation unit.
	- Add 'Clear Debris Now' and 'Clear Bystanders Now' buttons to the Vessel Spawner window (in Spawn Options).
	- Option for using the old format of the Vessel Switcher window ('t'). Option for reassigning teams on spawn or retaining the original team name defined in the SPH.

	- Option to reset maxHitPoints on vessels loaded into flight mode (e.g., during spawning). Uses the MM patched value if available.
	- More consistent addition of _1, _2, etc., to vessel names which should make teams of the same vessel have valid results summaries in many cases without having to rename each craft (which is still a better solution!), not just the files.
	- Add RESULT line to competition log to indicate overall result of the competition (needed for teams).
	- Updated format of log files for teams. Updated tournament parsing script.
	- Add break-down of deaths (clean Bullets, clean Missiles, clean Rams, Assists, Suicides) and kills (Bullets, Missiles, Rams), and normalised death order and death time to the results summary.
	- Set KSP version of SpawnProbe to 1.9.0 to avoid issues with spawning on older installations.

	- Free-falling kerbals deploy parachutes.
	- Kerbals in falling command seats leave the seat.
	- Vessels (and kerbals therein) are recovered during spawning instead of getting destroyed.
	- Surviving kerbals are recovered and immediately available for flying in the next competition instead of being MIA.
	- Ejection from cockpits is still a WIP.
	Battle Damage:
	- Battle damage is now configurable with multiple sub-categories, with the following toggles. Per-hit proc chance is also adjustable.
	- Fuel Tanks
		- FuelTanks will now leak when hit
		- Tanks may be configured to be self-sealing, trading some fuel capacity for leak resistance
		- Tank leak rate and leak duration can be adjusted
	- Ammo Boxes
		- Ammo boxes will potentially explode if hit
		- Ammo Boxes can be set to explode when destroyed
		- Adds ModuleCASE to ammo parts. Caselevel can be set from 0-2, higher levels reduce ammo explosion damage, at the cost of increased mass and cost.
	- Engines
		- Engine thrust reduced when hit, will start leaking fuel/catch fire/shut down when badly damaged
		- Intakes performance reduced when hit
		- Engine Gimbals can fail when hit
	- Wings
		- Wing damage per hit reduced
		- Wing lift loss capped at 50% total lift
		- Wing damage per hit is now configurable
		- Ailerons can fail when hit
	- Subsystems
		- Subsystem components
		- SAS/Radar/etc can be disabled when hit
	- Command
		- Control damage when hit
		- Pilots can be killed from cockpit damage
	- Fires - if a tank is leaking fuel, chance for leak to ignite
		- Fire damage over time
		- Fires in cockpits or other crewed or crew adjacent parts will be automatically extinguished.
		- Adds ModuleSelfSealingTank, can be toggled to prevent tanks leaks until tank receives substantial damage. it also adds the ability to configure fueltanks and engines to carry firebottles to extinguish fires
	RCS:
	- Improved RCS calculation accuracy and speed, your craft's RCS may be slightly different from 1.4.0.7
	- Recalculate RCS occasionally when parts are lost (to account for damage or missiles firing)
	- Fix engine afterburner textures affecting RCS calculation (was an issue for Tiger and Cheetah engines from AirplanePlus)
	Missiles:
	- New variables that affect heat seeking missile performance: lockedSeekerFOVBias, and lockedSeekerVelocityBias. See Sidewinder config file for more details.
	- Fixed allAspect and maxOffBoresight to work as intended. Vertical launch systems (VLS) and high off-boresight missiles should work as intended. See AIM-120 config file for details.
	- Add ability for Air-to-Ground missiles to lead targets based on their velocity.
	- Fixed Dynamic Launch Zone calculation, should result in more close-range missile fires and high off-boresight missiles only firing when they are likely to hit their target.
	- Better explanation of what missile parameters do added to Sidewinder and AIM-120 config files (new heat seeker value description in Sidewinder config file).
	- Updated torpedo tuning from Kurgan.
	Target Priority:
	- Target acceleration target priority now returns TWR/10 instead of instantaneous acceleration/10. Is set to -1 when target craft loses engines.
	- Less teammates engaging target priority now returns -1 when all teammates are engaging the same target instead of 0 (allows for better ganging up on the same target).
	Parts:
	- New armor panels, rescaled armor panel part mass, cost, HP to scale properly based on size.
	- Remove AIM-4 missiles, are moved to the Flying Circus mod for now, planned to be re-released in a future BDA expansion mod.
	- Added new Typhoon engine to fill the gap between Juno and Panther.
	Effects:
	- New FireFX effect

	- Improvements to RCS/stealth/ECM:
		- Craft with a lower modified radar signature (from ECM Modules that reduce signature) no longer have increased lock range. The range at which craft are locked will be accurate based on the RCS Window in the SPH/VAB if no jammers are used.
		- Re-worked RCS system. Calculate 95 azimuth/elevation pairs across 0-180 deg Az, 23 to -23 deg El, take the 3rd quartile of the distribution to use as the total RCS.
		- Scale RCS up by 4 to better match reality and provide better balancing against stock radars.
		- Display worst three Az/El pairs in the BDA editor window so that users can improve their design.
		- Fix to turn on all ECM jammers when an incoming radar-missile is detected.
	- Improvements to missiles:
		- Allow firing multiple missiles at the same radar target without losing radar lock. Firing missiles at multiple locked targets needs considerable work to be feasible.
		- Fix known issues with terminal guidance.
		- Add option for configuring FireFOV of a turret (fires when pointing within this angle of target). Reduce step size of fire interval to 0.5s.
	- Improvements to pilot AI:
		- Allow users to set "Firing Angle," the angle the weapons are within of being on target before firing. Default is 1 deg. Setting is on Weapons Manager. Setting only affects weapons with a yaw and pitch range of less than 5 degrees for both axes.
		- Make wing commander 'spread' and 'lag' values persistent.
		- Allow pilots in the "Attack" command to evade if they are being fired at by another craft
		- Sliders for controlling threshold and period of collision avoidance between vessels.
		- Allow craft to evade if they are under attack while being commanded to "Attack."
	- UI improvements:
		- Improved behaviour for entering spawn coordinates and altitude.
		- Add a slider in tournament settings to control delay between heats.
	- Other improvements:
		- Further balancing of the 30mm tnt mass to 0.077 (from 0.081).
		- B9 Proc Wings HP patch

	- Deploy halo chute for falling kerbals. Add AG to WM to deploy chutes on external kerbals.

v1.3.8.1
FIXES
	- Report death time to web orchestration in seconds instead of minutes
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Autonomous combat seats: when disabled (default) during competitions, combat/command seats disable the AI when the kerbal leaves the seat and vessels that are comprised of only a single combat/command seat explode.
	- Reduce max fireBurstLength to 10 and stepIncrement to 0.05 to allow more control of gun burst length.
	- Updated HP patch from CeruleanEyes

v1.3.8
FIXES

		- Fixed decals not being returned to the object pool so that they work efficiently now.
	Other fixes:
		- Use the correct spawn distance value in the remote orchestration.
		- Unity's fake nulls strike again: properly reset explosion object pools on scene changes.
		- KSP is labelling some missiles as debris. Detect these and don't remove them.
		- Bugfixes, memory leak fixes and optimisations.
		- Don't use Parallel.ForEach to update ramming information as Unity doesn't like get_transform being called from threads.
		- Assign font attributes in Awake instead of Constructor.
		- Fix potential NRE in ApplyDamage in PooledBullet.cs
		- Fix a potential NRE in continuous spawning where a spawned vessel gets destroyed before it's activated.
		- Fix special case of vessels with combat seats getting renamed.
		- Reset spawn position and rotation after spawning as sometimes KSP packs and unpacks craft and resets things!
		- Wait an extra update during spawning to allow reference transforms to be assigned.
		- Use altitudes from FlightGlobals when raycasting fails during spawning.
IMPROVEMENTS
	Main improvements:
		- Rebalance of explosion damage from bullets to approximate the previous DPS of the browning, vulcan and gau-8.
		- AI/WM now cost 0.
	Other improvements:
		- Remove the '5' from the options for heat size in the automatic vessels per heat optimisation to ensure a minimum heat size of 5.
		- Add configurable keybindings for tournament setup and running. Improve layout of 'Edit Inputs' window.
		- Added an 'auto-enable vessel-switching' option to general settings. Added 'auto' mode for tournament generation that chooses an appropriate number of vessels per heat and distributes the deficit over multiple heats.
		- Set up paintball decal pools when the paintball toggle is toggled.
		- Extra damage sliders in-game
		- Small optimisation to avoid reallocating Ray instance in PooledBullet.cs
		- Add the explModelPath to the browninganm2.cfg
		- Use a split slider for tournament rounds setting to allow up to 100 rounds.
		- Reuse deathOrder variable instead of fetching it from BDACompetitionMode.Instance again.
		- Use minSpeed instead of idleSpeed in steer limiter. Scale possibleAccel by 1/15 as before (but without G) for now until we find a better solution.
		- Additional regular check for vessels renamed as planes due to the combat seat.
		- Automatically end a continuous spawning competition when there's nothing left to spawn and <2 active craft.
		- Add a max altitude GM killer.
		- Updated Python scripts for parsing competition results logs.
		- Also trigger competition end when there's only 1 team left.
		- Include engine acceleration but not gravity in GetSteerLimiterForSpeedAndPower as it makes gliders and RegainEnergy work better.
		- Use afterburners when regaining energy.
		- Trigger the target scan after all the teams have been assigned.
		- Enable target priority by default.
		- Stop extending when changing targets.
		- Include death time and normalised death order in web orchestration reporting with surviving player death order/time set to max

FIXES
	- Don't autodestruct missiles if the explosive parts are using the override.
	- Show message about why the vessel spawning timed out.
	- Prevent windows from being competely off-screen (the drag region may still be off-screen though). Toggling "Strict Window Boundaries" will bring all the windows onto the screen if you can't find them.
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Absolute Distance vs Distance Factor toggle and expanded Spawn Distance slider for ranges up to 20km. (Note: for distances over 10km, it struggles due to the PRE and terrain. Using an airborne spawn first can help fix this.)

* added in missing high speed missle fix.  somehow got lost in the merge migration.

v1.2.2.2
* Recompiled for KSP 1.4.5

* FIXES
	*Error spam in Log when a radar is destroyed.  An orphaned index was not properly being updated. 
	 Reported in BDAc Forum post: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155014-14x-bdarmory-continued-v1221-7102018-vessel-mover-camera-tools-bdmk22-destruction-effects-burn-together/&do=findComment&comment=3425233

v1.0.0

* NEW FEATURES:

  * Radar & Stealth, re-design of how the radar system works:
	- New radar reflection shader (credit: original great idea by JR!), calculating cross section in m^2:
	   + allows building for stealth using angled surfaces (“scatter those pesky radar waves away!”)
	   + calculation is normalized so that a 1x1 structural plate directly frontally facing the radar yields a return of exactly 1 m^2
	- Redesign of the radar system, radars all have different ranges & detection performance:
	   + radar part configs changed, new fields (floatcurves) to define detection and lock/track performance, new field to specify ground clutter effectiveness
	- New in-editor analysis window to help evaluate a craft’s cross section and performance against selectable radars
	- New options for configuration of radar guided missiles in the part config:
	   + can now explicitly specify active seeker performance (via a FloatCurve, similar to radars)
	   + can now explicitly specify the static radar cross section of a missile for detection purpose
	- Adjustment of the Chaff countermeasure system: more gradual effect of decoying missiles away (instead of previous “all-or-nothing”)
	- Adjustment of IR missiles and flare countermeasures: simulating now more of a “imaging infrared” seeker than an old dumb seeker – to be successfully decoyed, flares have to more closely match the thermal spectrum of the part the seeker has locked on to

  * Massive improvements to ballistic missile guidance and modular missiles, ability to simulate ICBM flight paths:
	- Ballistic guidance has been enhanced to allow firing missiles accurately even at distances greater than 500 km
	- A new field called BallisticOverShootFactor has been added to missiles, the greater the value the further the missile will go before the terminal maneuver begins
	- By default all missiles now can steer in vacuum. New field called "vacuumSteerable" can be set to false to disable this behaviour    
	- Auto SAS activation when the missile is fired. Before it was only activated if the parent vessel had it switched on.
	- Improved the Cruise and Ballistic Guidance. Ballistic Guidance will switch to AGM guidance as soon as it reached the 50% of the distance
	- Guard mode in space will consider orbiting vessels as "flying" (air targets), hence engagement of space targets is possible now
 
  * New dedicated sonar ping and torpedo ping sounds, courtesy of PapaJoe!

* FIXES / ENHANCEMENTS:

  * Localization updates, including chinese localization (thanks @ACEA)

  * Display ranges of RWR and radar display now linked, selectable display range of radar display up to configured PRE physics max range!
  * Window position saving also for vesselswitcher
  * Prevent active radar missiles locking onto anything they see, now obey engagement settings
  * Sonar pings and torpedos only show on RWR if vessel is splashed/submerged
  * Fix guard mode "cheating" - now must have detected an enemy with radar/sonar or with visual range before it can attack it
  * If a cruise missile has terminal guidance, it can be switched off (before launch) in the part action window. The missile will then be purely gps guided without engaging its terminal targeting mode
  * If debug labels are enabled, upon entering the editor all bda parts & their properties (if relevant for balancing) are dumped into .csv files for convenient analysis in excel
  * Complete review of all event handlers, should reduce some actual or potential nullrefs upon explosive vessel disassembly
  * General performance improvements due to code refactoring

	* Courtesy of SpannerMonkey 
		- BDA MK1 Sonar Pod
		- Sting Ray  BDA LightWeight Torpedo
		
* Notes on Naval Combat Features

	* Current implementation of "Sonar" reuses the current Radar code. Future state will have dedicated windows and naming convention
	* Activating a "Sonar" pod still says "Activate Radar"
	* A Sonar is defined by setting the rwrThreatType = 6
		- Sonar rules
			- Will only detect vessels that are underwater (> 20meters)
			- Sonar will not function if vessel is in flight
			- Sonar does not detect "Landed" vessels, only splashed
			- Normal Radar does not detect underwater vessels, still detects "Splashed" i.e. Boats
	* Engagment type "SLW" only targets underwater (submarines) and Splashed (Boats)
